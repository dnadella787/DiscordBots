This is just the code for the tutorial I used to learn the Python discord API. I used this website:

    https://realpython.com/how-to-make-a-discord-bot-python/

Much of the code is taken from there, with small tweaks here and there either from stack overflow or the actual discord.py documentation to learn some extra things that I needed for future purposes. Would recommend the tutorial, it is quite informative and good as far as an introduction goes.
